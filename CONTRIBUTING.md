## 1. Bug reports

We use GitHub issues for bug tracking.

First, check that your bug has been reported already. If not, open a new GitHub
issue. Make sure to include the following:

 - Steps to reproduce
 - Actual outcome
 - Expected outcome
 - How you're accessing Cloogle (through the frontend or directly to Clean)

<a name="patches"></a>

## 2. Submitting patches

### General

 - Fork the repo, make a topic branch and when done submit a pull request
 - If your PR fixes some issue, be sure to mention it in the commit message
   (e.g. `Fix #15`)
 - Keep PRs as focused as possible. If you intend to fix multiple, independent
   things, open multiple, separate PRs.
 - If you intend to make large changes, it's probably best to open an issue and
   discuss with the maintainers first.
 - If necessary, edit the Readme as well.

### Code style

 - Use tabs instead of spaces
 - Keep lines under 80 chars
 - When editing the frontend, do not use external frameworks (jQuery,
   bootstrap, etc.). We strive for minimality and elegance.

### Other stuff

 - Add yourself to the authors list in README.md
